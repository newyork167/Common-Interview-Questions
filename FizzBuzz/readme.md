FizzBuzz!?!?!
-------------
The almighty FizzBuzz that somehow gets so many students each year :P

The goal is to print out digits from 1 to 100 and if the number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" and if divisible by 5 print "Buzz". If it is divisible by both, you print "FizzBuzz" to the screen. Somehow this simple question is enough to trip up so many people each year in interviews.

My current version is trying to make the code as clean and efficient as possible.
